            Hi, I'm Sureena, a passionate software developer with a diverse skill set and a love for solving complex problems. Throughout my experience in software development, Iâ€™ve come to appreciate the importance of clear, robust technical documentation, a realization that became especially evident while working with the WiX framework to build installers for software products. It was then that I recognized how well-structured documentation can make products more understandable and accessible. Alongside my development skills, I focus on simplifying technology through thoughtful documentation. I'm particularly excited about leveraging AI methodologies and tools to make technology even more accessible to a broader audience. By integrating AI technologies like machine learning and natural language processing into my development process, I aim to improve both the way solutions are built and how they are experienced by users.
